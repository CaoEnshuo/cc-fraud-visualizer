        "abstract": "This study investigates 66 machine learning models to improve fraud detection, using a two-stage evaluation with stratified K-fold cross-validation on a European cardholder dataset. In the second stage, 19 resampling techniques are applied to top-performing algorithms from the first. The AllKNN-CatBoost combination achieves the best results, outperforming previous models with an AUC of 97.94%, Recall of 95.91%, and F1-Score of 87.40%.",
